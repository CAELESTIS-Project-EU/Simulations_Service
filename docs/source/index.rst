The CAELESTIS project, funded by the EU's Horizon Europe program, aims to revolutionize aircraft design and manufacturing towards achieving zero-carbon aviation. Here's a summarized overview of the project:

Project Goals: Focused on developing next-generation aircraft technologies, CAELESTIS aims to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption in the aviation industry. It's a response to the increasing environmental impact of aviation and the need for climate neutrality by 2050.

Hyperconnected Simulation Ecosystem: The project is developing an advanced simulation ecosystem for probabilistic design and predictive manufacturing of aircraft structures. This ecosystem leverages digital twins and high-performance computing (HPC) to execute complex calculations and predictions across the aviation value chain.

Virtual Prototyping and Digital Twins: CAELESTIS emphasizes groundbreaking research in virtual prototyping and digital twins, aiming to reduce the weight of aircraft and thereby lower fuel consumption and emissions.

Objectives and Strategies: The project's objectives include developing a digital thread across the value chain, advanced HPC-data analytics, smart manufacturing strategies, and promoting the CAELESTIS virtual prototyping ecosystem across the EU aeronautics industry.

Interoperable Simulation Ecosystem (ISE): An end-to-end ISE is being developed for multidirectional data flow, linking product design with CAD-CAE tools to optimize new aircraft and engine configurations. This ecosystem is expected to widen the aviation design space and improve production efficiency.

Use of High-Performance Computing (HPC): HPC is integral to CAELESTIS for handling complex simulations and data analyses required for developing and optimizing new aircraft designs. It supports the creation of digital twins, optimizes aircraft configurations, and improves manufacturing processes.

In summary, the CAELESTIS project represents a significant effort in using advanced simulation technologies, digital twins, and high-performance computing to create more efficient, environmentally friendly aircraft designs, thereby contributing to the European Green Deal and the broader goal of sustainable aviation.
